{"name":"491assignment2","tagline":"Interaction Assignment for TCSS 491 @UWT","body":"###Assignment 2 - Battle of Two Armies\r\n\r\nIn this simple simulation you are started with a blank field and two armies to populate. There are controls to select which army you want to spawn a soldiers for, as well as a small selection of formations you can choose from that will be placed when you click on the main board. \r\n\r\n###Interactions\r\n* Soldier Targeting: Upon spawning, the soldiers will identify the closest enemy soldier and begin to pursue them. \r\n* Commander - soldier connection: When a commander dies, it's army receives a debuff, lowering the army's hit chance by an additional 30%. This effect does not stack when multiple commanders are killed, but the debuff timer is reset with each additional commander death.\r\n\r\n###Controls\r\n* click buttons to determine which team and formation you want to spawn\r\n* click the main canvas to choose where you want to spawn the soldiers\r\n* click the start button to begin the fight. Clicking it again will freeze the soldiers in place, allowing you to place more soldiers mid-simulation if you want.\r\n* space bar pauses the game loop\r\n\r\n####Emergent behaviors\r\n* Selecting target based on proximity.\r\n* Changing targets when current target dies\r\n* Shrinking in size and receiving a debuff when a commander dies\r\n\r\n\r\n#Important: Due to the way I set up the second canvas, your browser window must be wide enough to have both canvases side by side.  \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
